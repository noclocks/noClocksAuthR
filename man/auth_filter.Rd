auth_filter(method = c("basic", "cookie"), api_key = get_api_key())
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{The authentication method.  Valid options are "basic" and/or "cookie".  If
"basic" is set, the filter will authenticate the request using basic auth.  If
"cookie", the filter will authenticate the request using the cookie.  If both
"cookie" and "basic" are set, then the filter will first attempt to authenticate
using the cookie, and, if that fails, it will attempt to authenticate using basic
auth.  If you use cookie based auth, and you want to send requests directly from the browser,
then be sure to set your Plumber API to allow for cookies.}
